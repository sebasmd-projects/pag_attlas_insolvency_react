Además, la crisis derivada de la pandemia de COVID-19 agravó mi situación, dejando en riesgo la estabilidad financiera tanto personal como familiar. Por ello, solicito la apertura del trámite de insolvencia para reestructurar mis deudas y proteger el patrimonio mínimo vital, permitiéndome recuperar la estabilidad económica y garantizar el bienestar de mi núcleo familiar.",

Adicionalmente, el incremento en el costo de vida profundizó mi desequilibrio económico. Por estas razones, solicito formalmente la apertura del trámite de insolvencia para proteger mi patrimonio mínimo vital y estabilizar mis finanzas.",
